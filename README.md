# Titanic Survival Prediction

This repository contains the Titanic dataset and associated code for analysis and exploration. The Titanic dataset is a historical dataset that has been widely used in machine learning and data science to predict survival outcomes on the Titanic.

## Overview

The Titanic dataset comprises information on passengers aboard the RMS Titanic, including whether they survived or not. The dataset includes various features, such as:

1. Passenger Class (Pclass)
2. Name
3. Sex
4. Age
5. Number of Siblings/Spouses Aboard (SibSp)
6. Number of Parents/Children Aboard (Parch)
7. Ticket
8. Fare
9. Cabin
10. Port of Embarkation (Embarked)

The primary goal of this dataset is to predict passenger survival based on these features..

## File Structure

- `titanic-data.csv`: The dataset in CSV format containing measurements of the iris flowers.
- `TITANIC_SURVIVAL_PREDICTION.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook file containing exploratory data analysis (EDA), data visualization, and machine learning models applied to the dataset.

## Usage

To utilize this dataset and associated code:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/umairahmed786/titanic-survival-prediction.git
2 Open and execute the TITANIC_SURVIVAL_PREDICTION.ipynb Jupyter Notebook on Google Colab.
